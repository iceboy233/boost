This repository contains the boost library with bazel build rules.

We recommend using this repository by adding a git_repository rule in your
WORKSPACE file:

git_repository(
    name = "org_boost_boost",
    commit = "...",
    remote = "https://github.com/iceboy233/boost.git",
)

And then you can reference to individual boost libraries like:

cc_binary(
    # ...
    deps = [
        # ...
        "@org_boost_boost//:asio",
    ],
)

Pull requests to add more boost libraries are welcome.

Currently pinned to boost-1.77.0. Tested under linux and Windows.
